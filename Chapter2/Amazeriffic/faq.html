    <h3>Q: A cheeseburger is more than just a sandwich, it is a wish fulfilled. </h3>
    <p>A: The palatable sensation we lovingly refer to as The Cheeseburger has a distinguished
      and illustrious history. It was born from humble roots, only to rise to well-seasoned greatness.</p>
    <h3>Q: Protein, iron, and calcium are some of the nutritional benefits associated with cheeseburgers.</h3>
    <p>A: We are lucky to live in a glorious age that gives us everything we could ask for
      as a human race. What more could you need when you have meat covered in cheese nestled
      between bread as a complete meal.</p>
    <h3>Q: Salad is essentially food for rabbits, so don’t bother wasting your time.</h3>
    <p>A: From smashed patties at Shake Shack to Glamburgers at Honky Tonk, there’s
      a little something for everyone. Some burgers are humble, and some are ostentatious,
      and you just have to try them all to figure out what you want.</p>
    <h3>Q: Cheeseburgers are like a metaphor for life.</h3>
    <p>A: Let us wax poetic about the beauty of the cheeseburger.
      The flavour gracefully dances across your palate like a majestic figure skater on ice.</p>
